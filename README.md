# Bank of Codepath Lab

For this activity, you'll be building out the UI for a new financial application that codepath has been prototyping. It's a simple banking app that helps users keep track of their finances and payments using an Express API and a React UI.

Your job is to wire up the React UI to interact with the already built Express API. Data in the Express API is persisted using a JSON file that will store all user activity.

First things first, navigate into both the api directory and the ui directory and run `npm install` to get the appropriate dependencies. Then make sure the express server is running with `npm start` in the api directory.
